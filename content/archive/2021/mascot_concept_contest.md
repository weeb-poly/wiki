## Mascot Concept Competiton

These are the mascots concepts from our mascot concept competition.
Rankings were decided by votes on a public poll which ran from 3/21/2021 18:00 EDT to 3/28/2021 22:00 EDT.
The current version of the mascot may differ from the submitted version.
We've shortened mascot descriptions to fit on the page.
All server mascots will be recieving their own wiki-like page with more information (WIP).
