Shion is a grad student at RPI/WPI. As a CSE major, they don’t really need the lab coat, but they wear one anyway.

<!--more-->

The registrar says that they graduated back in the 1970's, but they also have them marked as an incoming freshman so what do they know.

#### Ideas

Since the Mascots are still Work In Progress characters, we're still flushing them out.

Personality: cynical, kind, kuudere, sarcastic, stoic

TA for your CSE class (ECSE 4090 - Mechatronics) (idk, I'm not an engineer)

Mecha Fan (Will Rewatch Pacific Rim with you)

SIS-MAN mascot was based on one of their incomplete projects (something about flexing on tall people)
    
Occasionally tries to make jokes and references (El Psy Kongroo) to be "hip" with the "youngins" and cover it up when it inevitably fails

#### Notes

The Contest Design was a photobash of the original Picrew design as well another piece of art. The server icon is a headshot of the Contest Design as to not infringe on the original artist's work. We intend to have a fully original drawing of the character as part of the new mascot competition.
